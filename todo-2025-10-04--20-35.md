# IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST: Data Analysis and Visualization Dashboard

1. ~~Create analyze_data.py file that reads the Excel file and performs the required analysis for the three questions~~
2. ~~Calculate top 3 agent types with highest percentage of multimodal capability~~
3. ~~Calculate top 3 model architectures with highest percentage of multimodal capability~~  
4. ~~Calculate top 3 task categories with highest median bias detection score~~
5. ~~Generate data visualizations for each analysis~~
6. ~~Save the visualizations as base64 encoded strings to embed in HTML~~
7. ~~Create data-dashboard.html with all required information and visualizations~~
8. ~~Include processed data count (80 rows) in the dashboard~~
9. ~~Ensure the dashboard has a light theme design~~
10. ~~Ensure the dashboard is responsive for mobile browsers~~
11. ~~Test the solution by running analyze_data.py and verifying the HTML dashboard works correctly~~
