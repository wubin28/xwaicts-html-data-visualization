 ● [MODE: REVIEW]

   Implementation Summary
     • Executed the existing pipeline in venv to regenerate
       data-dashboard.html.
     • Implemented a CJK font rendering fix to remove
       “小方块/tofu” in chart titles and labels:
        • Matplotlib rcParams: svg.fonttype='none' to keep
          text as text; added a CJK-first font family stack.

        • Post-processed exported SVG to replace DejaVu
          Sans with a broader CJK-capable font stack.
        • Added CSS rule to enforce a CJK-capable font
          stack for .chart svg text.
     • Regenerated the dashboard and opened it with
       xdg-open.

   Verification Notes
     • Script ran successfully (exit code 0).
     • Header auto-detection worked: header row index=1;
       rows=80; required columns mapped correctly.
     • data-dashboard.html written and opened.
     • Console still shows Matplotlib DejaVu Sans glyph
       warnings during figure creation; this is expected
       because we post-fix the SVG font-family and let the
       browser render with CJK fonts. It does not affect the
        final browser rendering.
   Deviations From Plan
   ⚠️DEVIATION DETECTED: Introduced CJK font handling
   (Matplotlib rcParams, SVG post-processing, CSS font
   stack) to address browser rendering of Chinese text.
   This was not specified in the original plan or the
   supplementary checklist, but was implemented to
   fulfill the user’s explicit request to fix “小方块”.
     • Scope of deviation: Presentation-only changes; no
       impact to data logic, metrics, or file naming.
     • Rationale: Required to meet user’s display
       requirements on Windows (“Microsoft YaHei” etc.) and
       other platforms.
     • Risk: Low. Changes are additive and fall back
       gracefully to system fonts.

   Recommendation for Next Iteration (ICM Phase 1)
     • Update the plan to formalize a “Font & i18n” section
       specifying:
        • svg.fonttype='none' and a prioritized CJK font
          stack for cross-platform rendering.
        • Optional toggle to control SVG post-processing of
          font-family if needed.
        • Note that Matplotlib console glyph warnings are
          acceptable if browser output renders correctly.
   Verdict
   ❌IMPLEMENTATION DEVIATES FROM PLAN

   Reason: The font rendering fix was an unplanned
   addition. If you approve, we can update the plan
   accordingly and re-enter PLAN/EXECUTE to align
   documentation with implementation.
