● Update(CLAUDE.md)
  ⎿  Updated CLAUDE.md with 8 additions and 9 removals
       45    This project follows a strict 6-phase 
            development protocol with Iterative 
            Context Management:
       46    
       47    1. **Iterative Context Management** - 
            Regularly review and update context 
            files based on current iteration story
       48 -  2. **RESEARCH** - Information gathering
          -  and file reading only
       49 -  3. **INNOVATE** - Brainstorming 
          -  approaches without implementation
       50 -  4. **PLAN** - Create comprehensive 
          -  technical specifications and save to 
          -  timestamped todo file (format: 
          -  `todo-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md`)
       51 -  5. **EXECUTE** - Follow the plan 
          - exactly with no creative decisions
       52 -  6. **REVIEW** - Validate implementation
          -  against the original plan
       48 +  2. **RESEARCH** - Information gathering
          +  and file reading only (permitted: 
          + reading files, generating code to read 
          + files; forbidden: suggestions, 
          + implementations, planning)
       49 +  3. **INNOVATE** - Brainstorming 
          +  approaches without implementation
          +   (permitted: discussing ideas; 
          +  forbidden: concrete planning, 
          +  implementation details)
       50 +  4. **PLAN** - Create comprehensive 
          +  technical specifications and save to 
          +  timestamped todo file (format: 
          +  `todo-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md`)
          +   with numbered checklist
       51 +  5. **EXECUTE** - Follow the plan 
          + exactly with no creative decisions. Work
          +  on todos one by one, marking them off. 
          + Keep each task simple and minimal. 
          + Append review section at end.
       52 +  6. **REVIEW** - Validate implementation
          +  against the original plan. Flag any 
          + deviations using `⚠️DEVIATION DETECTED:`
          +  format. Conclude with `✅IMPLEMENTATION
          +  MATCHES PLAN EXACTLY` or 
          + `❌IMPLEMENTATION DEVIATES FROM PLAN`.
       53    
       54    **Critical**: Always declare your 
            current mode at the start of responses 
            using `[MODE: MODE_NAME]` format.
       55    
       56    ### Iterative Context Management
       57 -  The `icm-template.md` file serves as an
          -  Iterative Context Management template. 
          - When starting a new iteration:
       58 -  1. Copy the `icm-template.md` file
       59 -  2. Rename it to 
          - `icm-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md` (using 
          - current timestamp)
       60 -  3. Modify the content according to the 
          - specific story of the current iteration
       57 +  Templates are not currently in use. The
          +  workflow uses timestamped files:
       58 +  - `icm-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md` - 
          + Iterative context for each iteration
       59 +  - `todo-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md` - Task 
          + checklist created during PLAN mode
       60    
       61    ### Key Requirements
       62    - **Virtual Environment**: Must use the
             existing `venv` directory (never create
             a new one)

       114    ## ICM-RIPER-5 Protocol Details
       115    
       116 -  The project strictly follows the 
           - ICM-RIPER-5 methodology defined in 
           - `icm-riper-5.md`:
       116 +  **Purpose**: This protocol prevents 
           + unauthorized AI modifications by 
           + enforcing strict mode-based workflow.
       117    
       118 -  1. **RESEARCH** - Information 
           - gathering and file reading only 
           - (including generating code such as 
           - python to read files)
       119 -  2. **INNOVATE** - Brainstorming 
           - approaches without implementation
       120 -  3. **PLAN** - Create comprehensive 
           - technical specifications and save to 
           - timestamped todo file 
           - (`todo-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md`)
       121 -  4. **EXECUTE** - Follow the plan 
           - exactly with no creative decisions. 
           - Work on todos one by one, marking them 
           - off as completed. Keep each task simple
           -  and minimal. Append a review section 
           - at the end of the todo file summarizing
           -  changes.
       122 -  5. **REVIEW** - Validate 
           - implementation against the original 
           - plan. Flag any deviations using 
           - `⚠️DEVIATION DETECTED:` format. 
           - Conclude with `✅IMPLEMENTATION MATCHES
           -  PLAN EXACTLY` or `❌IMPLEMENTATION 
           - DEVIATES FROM PLAN`.
       123 -  
       124 -  **Critical Protocol Guidelines**:
       125 -  - Cannot transition between modes 
           - without explicit permission
       126 -  - Must declare current mode at the 
           - start of EVERY response
       127 -  - In EXECUTE mode, must follow the 
           - plan with 100% fidelity
       128 -  - In REVIEW mode, must flag even the 
           - smallest deviation
       129 -  - No authority to make independent 
           - decisions outside the declared mode
       130 -  
       131 -  **Mode Transition Signals**:
       118 +  ### Mode Transition Requirements
       119 +  Only transition modes with explicit 
           + signals:
       120    - "ENTER RESEARCH MODE"
       121    - "ENTER INNOVATE MODE"
       122    - "ENTER PLAN MODE"
       123    - "ENTER EXECUTE MODE"
       124    - "ENTER REVIEW MODE"
       125    
       126 +  ### Critical Protocol Guidelines
       127 +  - **Cannot** transition between modes 
           + without explicit permission
       128 +  - **Must** declare current mode at the
           +  start of EVERY response with `[MODE: 
           + MODE_NAME]`
       129 +  - In EXECUTE mode: follow the plan 
           + with 100% fidelity, immediately return 
           + to PLAN if deviation needed
       130 +  - In REVIEW mode: flag even the 
           + smallest deviation with `⚠️DEVIATION 
           + DETECTED:` format
       131 +  - **No** authority to make independent
           +  decisions outside the declared mode
       132 +  
       133 +  ### PLAN Mode Checklist Format
       134 +  ```
       135 +  IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST:
       136 +  1. [Specific action 1]
       137 +  2. [Specific action 2]
       138 +  ...
       139 +  n. [Final action]
       140 +  ```
       141 +  
       142 +  Save to `todo-yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm.md` in
           +  project root.

       144    ## Evaluation Context
       145    
       146    This is part of an AI coding tools 
             performance evaluation. Each git branch
              represents a single evaluation session
              with metadata in the branch name 
             indicating:

● Updated CLAUDE.md with the following improvements:

  1. Corrected file references: Replaced outdated
  icm-template.md, todo.md, bubbles.md,
  bubbling-logs.md with accurate timestamped file
  patterns and icm-bubble-template.md
  2. Enhanced ICM-RIPER-5 descriptions: Added specific
  permitted/forbidden actions for each mode to clarify
  boundaries
  3. Streamlined protocol details: Consolidated verbose
   protocol guidelines into concise, scannable format
  with clear action items
  4. Added checklist format: Included explicit example
  of PLAN mode checklist structure
  5. Clarified ICM workflow: Removed references to
  non-existent icm-template.md and explained current
  timestamped file approach

  The updated file maintains all essential information
  while being more accurate to the actual codebase
  state and easier to reference quickly.

     This file provides guidance to Claude Code
     (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this
     repository.
     ## Project Overview
     This is a Python-based data visualization project
     for analyzing an AI agent performance dataset. The
      project generates HTML dashboards to visualize
     insights from Excel data files containing agent
     performance metrics.
     **Important**: This project is part of an AI
     coding tools performance evaluation, comparing
     various AI-assisted programming tools (Claude
     Code, CodeBuddy Code, etc.) through practical
     implementation tasks using the ICMwRIPER-5
     methodology.
     … +157 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Created a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file with key
  improvements:

  Key Updates:
  1. Renamed protocol: Changed all references from
  "ICM-RIPER-5" to "ICMwRIPER-5" (Iterative Context
  Management with RIPER-5) to match README.md and
  actual file icmwriper-5.md
  2. Corrected file references: Updated to reflect
  actual files in the codebase:
    - icmwriper-5.md (not icm-riper-5.md)
    - icm-bubble-template.md (clarified as starting
  prompt template)
    - Proper timestamped file naming patterns
  3. Enhanced workflow clarity: Added detailed "Getting
   Started with ICMwRIPER-5 Method" section explaining
  the iteration process
  4. Improved commands section: Added venv creation
  commands and platform-specific Python command
  variations (python vs python3)
  5. Expanded evaluation context: Detailed branch
  naming convention with concrete examples showing how
  evaluation metadata is encoded
  6. Added project context: Emphasized this is an AI
  tools comparison project, not just a data
  visualization task

  The file now accurately reflects the current codebase
   state and provides clear guidance for future Claude
  Code instances working on this project.
