# Data Dashboard Implementation Bubbles

## Project Context
Based on the requirements in `requirements.md`, I need to create a comprehensive data dashboard for the Agentic AI Performance Dataset 2025. The dataset contains 80 records focusing on AI agent performance metrics.

## Requirements Analysis
The user wants:
1. A Python script (`read-excel-data.py`) to read and analyze Excel data
2. An HTML dashboard (`data-dashboard.html`) with visualizations
3. Answers to three specific questions about agent performance
4. Light color scheme design
5. Mobile-responsive layout
6. Static HTML with no external dependencies except Chart.js CDN

## Key Questions to Answer:
1. **Agent Types**: Top 3 agent types by multimodal capability percentage
2. **Model Architectures**: Top 3 model architectures by multimodal capability percentage
3. **Task Categories**: Top 3 task categories by median bias detection score

## Technical Approach
- Use pandas for data processing and analysis
- Chart.js for interactive visualizations
- CSS Grid/Flexbox for responsive layout
- Light color palette with pastels
- Mobile-first design approach

## Implementation Notes
- Must follow RIPER-5 protocol strictly
- Need to handle Excel file reading with proper error handling
- Dashboard should be self-contained HTML file
- All data processing must be accurate and reproducible
- Charts must be interactive and mobile-friendly

## Current Status
- Planning phase complete
- Implementation checklist created in `todo.md`
- Ready to proceed to execution phase upon approval
