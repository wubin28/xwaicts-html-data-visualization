## English Translation of User's Requirement

The user has a Kaggle dataset named "@first-80-rows-agentic_ai_performance_dataset_20250622.xlsx" called "Agentic AI Performance Dataset 2025", focusing on AI agent performance with 3 main questions:

(1) Which are the top 3 agent types with the highest proportion of multimodal_capability support within each agent type?

(2) Which are the top 3 model architectures with the highest proportion of multimodal_capability support within each model architecture?

(3) Which are the top 3 task categories with the highest median bias_detection scores in agent performance?

The user wants to visualize this dataset by creating a comprehensive data dashboard named "data-dashboard.html" in HTML format.

The dashboard should include data visualization design and display the actual number of dataset records processed (the dataset has 80 records total, but should only display the actual number of rows read and processed).

The dashboard should use a light color scheme and provide directly runnable static HTML code.

No dynamic effects or static images are needed, and it should not depend on loading Excel files to run the HTML code. All charts must display completely in mobile browsers.

The Python code used to read the Excel dataset and analyze the data should be saved in a file named "read-excel-data.py" for later execution and code review.

## Development Progress Log

**Step 1-7 Completed: Python Script Creation**
- Created comprehensive Python data analysis script with detailed bilingual comments
- Implemented all three required analyses with proper pandas operations
- Added JavaScript data generation function for HTML embedding
- Script includes error handling and clear output formatting

**Step 8-15 Completed: HTML Dashboard Creation**
- Created complete HTML5 dashboard with embedded CSS and JavaScript
- Implemented responsive design with light color theme for mobile compatibility
- Built three analysis sections with Canvas-based horizontal bar charts
- Added dynamic data tables with proper formatting and highlighting
- Embedded processed data directly in JavaScript arrays (no external file dependencies)
- Included bilingual content (Chinese/English) for better accessibility

**Step 16-20 Completed: Testing and Validation**
- Successfully tested HTML file structure and Canvas chart functionality
- Verified mobile-responsive design with @media queries for different screen sizes
- Validated Python script independent execution (260 lines of well-documented code)
- Confirmed complete workflow from Excel data processing to interactive HTML dashboard
- Final deliverables: read-excel-data.py and data-dashboard.html are fully functional

**Final Results Summary**
- Processed 80 rows of AI agent performance data from Excel dataset
- Generated beginner-friendly code with extensive bilingual comments
- Created self-contained HTML dashboard (529 lines) requiring no external dependencies
- Successfully answered all three research questions with interactive visualizations
