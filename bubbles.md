## EXECUTE MODE ENTRY - Data Dashboard Generation Project

**Original Prompt Translation:**
The user has requested to enter EXECUTE MODE to implement the comprehensive technical specification for creating a beginner-friendly data dashboard. The project involves:

1. Reading Excel dataset `first-80-rows-agentic_ai_performance_dataset_20250622.xlsx`
2. Performing three specific analyses on agent types, model architectures, and task categories
3. Generating a standalone HTML dashboard with embedded Chart.js visualizations
4. Creating Python code suitable for beginners to study and learn from
5. Ensuring mobile-responsive design with light color scheme
6. Displaying actual processed record count (80 rows)

**Implementation Plan:** Following the 20-item checklist from PLAN mode exactly as specified.

**Execution Started:** Beginning implementation of checklist items sequentially.

**Step 1 Completed:** Created `analyze_data.py` file with proper imports (pandas, json) and educational comments for beginners.

**Precision Fix Applied:** Updated `analyze_task_categories_bias_detection()` function to use 4 decimal places precision instead of 1 decimal place for bias detection median scores. This ensures more accurate ranking and results for the third analysis question.

**Changes Made:**
1. Changed `round(median_score, 1)` to `round(median_score, 4)` in bias_medians dictionary
2. Updated print statements to display 4 decimal places consistently using `.4f` format
3. Modified Chart.js tooltip and y-axis tick formatting to show 4 decimal places using `.toFixed(4)`
4. Maintained correct sorting and top 3 selection logic

**Ready for Testing:** The precision issue has been resolved. Please run `python analyze_data.py` to generate the corrected dashboard.
