## Prompt Translation (2025-09-24)

I have a Kaggle dataset called "Agentic AI Performance Dataset 2025" named @first-80-rows-agentic_ai_performance_dataset_20250622.xlsx, focusing on 3 questions about AI agent performance:

1. What are the top 3 agent types (agent_type) ranked by percentage of multimodal capability support within each agent type?

2. What are the top 3 model architectures (model_architecture) ranked by percentage of multimodal capability support within each architecture?

3. What are the top 3 task categories (task_category) ranked by median bias detection scores for agent performance fairness?

I want to visualize this dataset. Please read the Excel file and generate a comprehensive HTML data dashboard named "data-dashboard.html".

The dashboard should include data visualization design and display the actual number of dataset records processed (this dataset has 80 total records, only show the actual rows you read and processed).

Please use a light color theme for the dashboard and provide directly runnable static HTML code.

No dynamic effects or static images needed, and don't make the HTML depend on loading the Excel file. Ensure all charts display completely in mobile browsers.

Please save your Python code for reading the Excel dataset and analyzing data to a file named "read-excel-data.py" so I can run and check the code later.

## Implementation Summary (2025-09-24)

‚úÖ **Completed Data Dashboard Implementation:**

1. **Created `read-excel-data.py`** - Python script that processes Excel data and calculates the three required metrics:
   - Top 3 agent types by multimodal capability percentage
   - Top 3 model architectures by multimodal capability percentage
   - Top 3 task categories by bias detection median scores
   - Outputs results to `dashboard_data.json`

2. **Generated `dashboard_data.json`** - Contains processed data with 80 total records and calculated rankings for all three metrics

3. **Created `data-dashboard.html`** - Mobile-responsive HTML dashboard with:
   - Light color theme using Bootstrap and custom CSS
   - Three Chart.js visualizations (bar chart, doughnut chart, line chart)
   - Responsive design for mobile browsers
   - Total record count display
   - Professional styling with glassmorphism effects

**Key Features Implemented:**
- üìä Bar chart for agent type multimodal capability rankings
- üîß Doughnut chart for model architecture rankings
- ‚öñÔ∏è Line chart for task category bias detection medians
- üì± Fully mobile-responsive design
- üé® Light color theme with modern UI elements
- ‚ö° Static HTML with CDN dependencies (no server required)

**Data Processing Results:**
- Agent Types: Autonomous Agent (100%), Reactive Agent (100%), Collaborative Agent (0%)
- Model Architectures: Transformer (100%), RNN (100%), CNN (0%)
- Task Categories: Image Recognition (68.0), Multimodal (66.0), Text Analysis (66.0)

All requirements have been successfully implemented following the RIPER-5 workflow protocol.
