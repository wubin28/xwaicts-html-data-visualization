Please strictly follow the RIPER-5 workflow protocol to complete the data dashboard generation requirements. You must begin every response by declaring your current mode in brackets (e.g., [MODE: RESEARCH]).

**Workflow Reference:**
- RIPER-5 workflow protocol: See `rules-riper5.md`
- Data dashboard requirements: See `requirements.md`

**Python Environment Setup Requirements:**
1. Create a Python virtual environment in a directory named exactly `venv` (no other names allowed)
2. Install all required dependencies within this virtual environment
3. Run all Python code within this virtual environment

**Security Protocol:**
- If sudo password is required during the process (e.g., when installing Python packages), pause execution and wait for user input
- For privacy protection, each password character entered will be displayed as an asterisk (*)
- Do not modify the planned workflow to simplify the process - follow the plan exactly as specified

**Key Requirements from Context:**
- Analyze the Kaggle dataset "Agentic AI Performance Dataset 2025" from `first-80-rows-agentic_ai_performance_dataset_20250622.xlsx`
- Create Python analysis code saved as `analyze_data.py` (or `read-excel-data.py` as specified in requirements)
- Generate an HTML dashboard saved as `data-dashboard.html`
- Use light color scheme design
- Ensure mobile browser compatibility
- Display actual processed record count (dataset contains 80 rows)
- Create static HTML that doesn't depend on loading Excel files at runtime

**RIPER-5 Mode Transitions:**
Only transition between modes when explicitly commanded with:
- "ENTER RESEARCH MODE"
- "ENTER INNOVATE MODE" 
- "ENTER PLAN MODE"
- "ENTER EXECUTE MODE"
- "ENTER REVIEW MODE"

Wait for explicit mode transition commands before proceeding to the next phase.

[MODE: RESEARCH]

Thank you for the clarifications. I will now examine the Excel file structure to understand the data format and columns. Let me analyze the `first-80-rows-agentic_ai_performance_dataset_20250622.xlsx` file.

My search failed to locate the Excel file content or structure information. I need to examine the actual Excel file to understand:

1. **Column Structure Analysis Needed:**
   - Exact column names (especially `agent_type`, `multimodal_capability`, `model_architecture`, `task_category`, `bias_detection`)
   - Data types in each column
   - Sample values to understand data format

2. **Data Quality Assessment Needed:**
   - Total row count verification (should be 80 rows)
   - Missing or null values identification
   - Data consistency patterns

3. **Key Columns for Analysis:**
   - `agent_type` + `multimodal_capability` (for question 1)
   - `model_architecture` + `multimodal_capability` (for question 2)  
   - `task_category` + `bias_detection` (for question 3)

**Request for File Access:**
Could you please attach the Excel file using the "@" syntax (e.g., @first-80-rows-agentic_ai_performance_dataset_20250622.xlsx) so I can examine its structure and content? This will allow me to:

- Verify the exact column names and data types
- Understand the data format and any preprocessing needs
- Confirm the 80-row count
- Identify any data quality issues

Once I can examine the file structure, I will provide a complete analysis of the data format and be ready for the next mode transition.

- Data types and formats
- Sample data values
- Data quality issues
- Row count verification

**Alternative Approach for Research:**
Since I cannot directly examine the Excel file content, could you please:

1. **Share a few sample rows** from the Excel file showing the column headers and some data values?
2. **Confirm the exact column names** especially for our key analysis columns:
   - `agent_type`
   - `multimodal_capability` 
   - `model_architecture`
   - `task_category`
   - `bias_detection`

3. **Provide basic data format information** such as:
   - How is `multimodal_capability` stored? (Yes/No, True/False, 1/0, etc.)
   - How is `bias_detection` stored? (numeric scores, percentages, etc.)
   - What are some example values for `agent_type`, `model_architecture`, and `task_category`?

**What I Can Proceed With:**
Once I have this basic structure information, I can complete the RESEARCH mode analysis and be ready for the next mode transition. This will allow me to:
- Understand the data preprocessing requirements
- Plan the appropriate analysis methods
- Design the visualization approach
- Prepare for beginner-friendly code implementation

Please provide this structural information so I can complete the RESEARCH phase effectively.

[MODE: RESEARCH]

I understand the request to create a Python virtual environment and analyze the dataset. However, I must clarify my limitations within the RESEARCH mode protocol:

**RESEARCH Mode Constraints:**
According to the RIPER-5 protocol, in RESEARCH mode I am only permitted to:
- Gather information
- Ask clarifying questions
- Understand existing code structure
- Make observations

I am **forbidden** from:
- Creating implementations
- Writing code
- Setting up environments
- Taking any action beyond information gathering

**Current Research Status:**
I need to complete the data structure analysis first before any implementation can occur. Since I cannot directly access the Excel file content, I require one of these approaches:

**Option 1: Manual Data Sample**
Could you provide a small sample of the Excel data showing:
- Column headers
- 3-5 sample rows
- Data types for key columns

**Option 2: Existing Analysis**
If you have any existing Python code that reads this file, I could examine that code structure.

**Research Questions Still Pending:**
1. What are the exact column names in the Excel file?
2. How is `multimodal_capability` formatted? (boolean, text, numeric?)
3. How is `bias_detection` stored? (scores, percentages, categories?)
4. What are sample values for `agent_type`, `model_architecture`, `task_category`?

**Next Steps:**
Once I complete the data structure research, I will be ready for you to command "ENTER PLAN MODE" where I can then design the implementation approach including the virtual environment setup and Python analysis code.

Please provide the data structure information so I can complete the RESEARCH phase according to protocol.
