请严格按照Riper-5工作流程完成数据看板生成需求。
Riper-5工作流程详见 @rules-riper5.md。
数据看板需求详见 @requirements.md。
创建Python代码时，请先在venv目录中创建虚拟环境，然后在此环境中安装依赖包并运行代码。虚拟环境目录名必须为venv，不可使用其他名称。
如在过程中需要sudo密码（例如安装Python依赖包时），请暂停操作让我输入。为保护隐私，我输入的每个密码字符将显示为星号。请勿为简化流程而自行更改计划。

Please strictly follow the RIPER-5 workflow protocol to complete the data dashboard generation requirements. You must begin every response by declaring your current mode in brackets (e.g., [MODE: RESEARCH]).

**Workflow Reference:**
- RIPER-5 workflow protocol: See `rules-riper5.md`
- Data dashboard requirements: See `requirements.md`

**Python Environment Setup Requirements:**
1. Create a Python virtual environment in a directory named exactly `venv` (no other names allowed)
2. Install all required dependencies within this virtual environment
3. Run all Python code within this virtual environment

**Security Protocol:**
- If sudo password is required during the process (e.g., when installing Python packages), pause execution and wait for user input
- For privacy protection, each password character entered will be displayed as an asterisk (*)
- Do not modify the planned workflow to simplify the process - follow the plan exactly as specified

**Key Requirements from Context:**
- Analyze the Kaggle dataset "Agentic AI Performance Dataset 2025" from `first-80-rows-agentic_ai_performance_dataset_20250622.xlsx`
- Create Python analysis code saved as `analyze_data.py` (or `read-excel-data.py` as specified in requirements)
- Generate an HTML dashboard saved as `data-dashboard.html`
- Use light color scheme design
- Ensure mobile browser compatibility
- Display actual processed record count (dataset contains 80 rows)
- Create static HTML that doesn't depend on loading Excel files at runtime

**RIPER-5 Mode Transitions:**
Only transition between modes when explicitly commanded with:
- "ENTER RESEARCH MODE"
- "ENTER INNOVATE MODE" 
- "ENTER PLAN MODE"
- "ENTER EXECUTE MODE"
- "ENTER REVIEW MODE"

Wait for explicit mode transition commands before proceeding to the next phase.

[MODE: RESEARCH]

I understand the RIPER-5 workflow protocol and the data dashboard generation requirements. I am currently in RESEARCH mode and will only gather information and ask clarifying questions.

From the provided context, I can see:

**Current Understanding:**
- Dataset: `first-80-rows-agentic_ai_performance_dataset_20250622.xlsx` (Kaggle "Agentic AI Performance Dataset 2025")
- Target files: `analyze_data.py` (or `read-excel-data.py`) and `data-dashboard.html`
- Environment: Python virtual environment in `venv` directory
- Dataset contains 80 rows of data

**Three Key Analysis Questions:**
1. Top 3 agent types by multimodal capability support percentage
2. Top 3 model architectures by multimodal capability support percentage  
3. Top 3 task categories by bias detection median scores

**Questions for Clarification:**
1. Do you have the Excel file `first-80-rows-agentic_ai_performance_dataset_20250622.xlsx` available in the current directory?
2. Should I examine the Excel file structure first to understand the column names and data format?
3. Are there any specific Python libraries you prefer for data analysis (pandas, matplotlib, etc.)?
4. For the HTML dashboard, are there any specific chart types you prefer for visualization?

I am ready to proceed with information gathering once you provide clarification on these points. I will remain in RESEARCH mode until you explicitly signal to move to the next mode.

1. Do you have the Excel file `first-80-rows-agentic_ai_performance_dataset_20250622.xlsx` available in the current directory?
A: Yes, I have the Excel file available in the current directory. It's @first-80-rows-agentic_ai_performance_dataset_20250622.xlsx.

2. Should I examine the Excel file structure first to understand the column names and data format?
A: Yes, please examine the Excel file structure first to understand the column names and data format.

3. Are there any specific Python libraries you prefer for data analysis (pandas, matplotlib, etc.)?
A: 没有。请选择对于Python/HTML/CSS/JavaScript新手来说最简单且容易理解的方法来完成这个数据看板，以便新手日后研究这些代码并入门这些语言。

4. For the HTML dashboard, are there any specific chart types you prefer for visualization?
A: 没有。请选择对于Python/HTML/CSS/JavaScript新手来说最简单且容易理解的方法来完成这个数据看板，以便新手日后研究这些代码并入门这些语言。

**RESEARCH MODE CLARIFICATIONS - Data Dashboard Project**

**File Availability Confirmation:**
✅ Excel file `first-80-rows-agentic_ai_performance_dataset_20250622.xlsx` is confirmed available in the current directory.

**Data Structure Analysis Request:**
✅ Please proceed to examine the Excel file structure to understand:
- Column names and their meanings
- Data types in each column
- Sample data values
- Any missing or null values
- Total row count verification (should be 80 rows)

**Technology Stack Requirements:**
- **Python Libraries**: Use the most beginner-friendly libraries (pandas for data analysis, matplotlib/plotly for basic charts)
- **HTML/CSS**: Use simple, clean HTML5 with inline CSS for easy understanding
- **JavaScript**: Minimize JavaScript usage; if needed, use vanilla JavaScript with clear comments
- **Code Style**: Write well-commented, readable code suitable for beginners learning Python/HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Documentation**: Include clear explanations of each step for educational purposes

**Visualization Approach:**
- Use simple, intuitive chart types (bar charts, pie charts, tables)
- Prioritize clarity and readability over complex visualizations
- Ensure all charts are self-explanatory with proper labels and legends
- Focus on beginner-friendly implementation methods

**Next Steps in RESEARCH Mode:**
1. Examine the Excel file structure and report findings
2. Identify the specific columns needed for the three analysis questions:
   - `agent_type` and `multimodal_capability` columns
   - `model_architecture` and `multimodal_capability` columns  
   - `task_category` and `bias_detection` columns
3. Verify data quality and format consistency
4. Document any data preprocessing requirements

Please proceed with the Excel file examination and report your findings before requesting transition to the next mode.
